ALGORITHM ANALYSIS FOR INSERT-SORT QUICK-SORT MERGE-SORT

Enter '0' then '0' to execute given assignment. This will result in the program running
through insert-sort, quick-sort, and merge-sort from a vector from 5000 up to 100000 in
5000 incremental intervals, and taking the average of three sorts. The results will be
written to a .csv file.



---INTRODUCTION--- 

This program uses a single character input menu. When a menu is displayed, it will ask
for an input of some numeric entry such as '0' or '1'. Entering more than one character
is not accepted as well as no input at all. The functionality is basic for running the 
intended purpose and allowing for basic customization.


#MAIN MENU
Entering [0] will result in initilazation mean for original assignment

Entering [1] for the main menu will allow you to enter custom values for the sorting
program.
	ns = initial number of elements
	nf = maximum number of elements
	delta = the increment for number of elements per loop
	m = total number of repeated times the algorithm is ran and averaged at
		each incremenet

Entering [2] will result in a minimal run.

Entering [3] will quit the program.

#ALGORITHM SORTER MENU
Self explanatary.
